### <a name="workstations"></a> Workstations

Workstations are a way to make it easy for you to open a set of applications by 
simple commands.

The set of configurations are saved on **.chid.config** file.

**Note:** All commands bellow is possible run with prefix: `$ chid workstation [command]` 

* `$ chid workstation list` - List all workstations
* `$ chid workstation create` - Create a new workstation. Chid will ask for a name to set the 
new workstation and after that will list all **applications** available on your 
system to chosse witch one you wanna add
* `$ chid workstation destroy` - Chid will ask which workstation you want to destroy and chid 
will destroy it after choose
* `$ chid workstation open` - Open a specific workstation. Chid will list all workstations to 
choose one of them to open all applications
* `$ chid workstation open -name [workstation_name]` - Open a specific workstation without choose 
from a list. Eg.: `$ chid workstation open -name base` - It will open all applications inside the 
**base** workstation

**Note:** For linux users the `$chid workstation create` is not working. You need create 
manually (editing the .chid.config file). Will be explained how on
**How configure and customize your workstations** topic

### <a name="tmux"></a> Tmux

If you use Tmux as I do for development, this is a nice Command Feature!

This feature is based on some templates you will create on `~/.chid.config` file to open easily all your Dev Env

This Feature have **2** commands, `list` and `open`

* `$ chid tmux list` - List all existent tmux template
* `$ chid tmux create` - Open a specific tmux template

#### An example of Template you will add on **~/.chid.config**:

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :workstations: {}
  :tmux_templates:
    :NAME_YOUR_PROJECT:
    - tmux new -s $$template_name$$ -n app -d;
    - tmux send-keys -t $$template_name$$ 'cd DIRECTORY_PROJECT_PATH'
      C-m;
    - tmux send-keys -t $$template_name$$ 'vim' C-m C-m;
    - tmux new-window -n tests -t $$template_name$$;
    - tmux send-keys -t $$template_name$$ 'cd DIRECTORY_PROJECT_PATH'
      C-m;
    - tmux new-window -n server -t $$template_name$$;
    - tmux send-keys -t $$template_name$$ 'cd DIRECTORY_PROJECT_PATH'
      C-m;
    - tmux attach -t $$template_name$$;
```

The example above each line is a tmux command. You can do what you need. In this case we have only two variables to replace:
- NAME_YOUR_PROJECT -> the name which will appear on `tmux list`
- DIRECTORY_PROJECT_PATH -> the full path of the your directory project. Ex.: `~/Workspaces/ruby-workspace/chid/`

The commands above means those steps:  
1- Create a new Tmux session with `app` name for the first tab or Find an existent one and Open it  
2- Open the folder project on the tmux tab `app`  
3- Open a new tab called `vim` and open the vim on the folder project  
4- Open a new tab called `server` and go to the folder project  

**base** workstation

## <a name="configure-workstation"></a> How configure and customize your workstations

The chid configuration file is installed on **~/.chid.config**. You can open: `$ chid config`

Chid config is a **YAML** file.

You can create the workstations just adding on :workstations: key.

The initial chid config file will be like:

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :workstations: {}
  :tmux_templates: {}
```

#### Base configuration

To add a new *workstation* you can edit like:

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :workstations:
    :base: # Workstation Name
    - iTerm #Application Name
    - Safari
    - Slack
  :tmux_templates: {}
```
![configchid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47482049/67722353-d2672680-f9d0-11e9-8c52-8dad5d2ad22f.gif)

After edit you can open the **base** workstation running:

* `$ chid workstation open -name base`
* `$ chid workstation open -n base`

#### Advance configuration

Is possible you can customize some options with each Application when will open it

 - Open the Terminal in a specific folder  
 - Open a Safari with a specific URL
 - Any options which your application can use

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :workstations:
    :base: # Workstation Name
    - iTerm ~/Workspaces/rake-workspace/chid/ & rspec  # Will open 
    # in a specific folder and will run the rspec (run all tests)
    - Safari https://github.com/rachidcalazans/chid # Will open the Safari 
    # in a specific URL
  :tmux_templates: {}
```
